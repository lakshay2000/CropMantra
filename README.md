Agriculture in India is livelihood for a majority of the population and can never be underestimated. However, the agricultural sector is going through most stressed phase in the last three decades. Indian agriculture is plagued by several problems; some of them are natural and some others are manmade. Nearly three-quarters of India’s families depend on rural incomes. Every solution if rightly executed can make a huge difference.
